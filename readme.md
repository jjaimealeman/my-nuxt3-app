Playing with Nuxt 3 again ;)

```sh
‚îî‚îÄ>npx nuxi init nuxt3-app
Need to install the following packages:
  nuxi
Ok to proceed? (y)
Nuxt CLI v3.0.0-27468803.23e7afb                                                                                                                                                                           19:42:00
‚Ñπ cloned nuxt/starter#v3 to /home/jaime/www/nuxt3-app                                                                                                                                                      19:42:01

 üéâ  Another wicked Nuxt project just made! Next steps:

     üìÅ  `cd nuxt3-app`

     üíø  Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist`

     üöÄ  Start development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` or `pnpm run dev
```

I'm sticking with YARN for this set up, so:
`yarn install`
`yarn dev -o` automatically opens localhost:3000
`yarn dev` does not automatically open localhost:3000

Spent the past two days playing with UniCSS but chose instead to go back to WindiCSS.

Installed and enabled PWA module.
Now I will test with `git push` and Deploy to Netlify for testing.

PWA didn't work. Gotta research later and out why.

Now taking this course
